If JSSE receives a fatal SSL alert message, it invalidates the current
session and closes the socket.  It should also throw an exception
stating the cause of the problem, but currently doesn't.  Later
operations such as read() or write() on the socket will correctly
report that the socket is closed, but with no reason given.

<P>
<LI>
The "PKCS12" KeyStore type included in the JSSE reference
implementation security provider only supports load() but not save().
This means that the keytool utility may be used to view but not edit
pkcs12 files.  The implementation supports PBEWithSHAAnd3KeyTripleDES
for shrouded private keys and PBEWithSHAAnd40BitRC2 for safe contents
elements.  This should be compatible with PKCS12 files exported by
Netscape Communicator version 4.04 and later.  PKCS12 files using other
algorithms can first be imported to Communicator and then exported in a
compatible format.
