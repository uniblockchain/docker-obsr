<LI><A NAME="1"><strong>Q:</strong> What does JSSE 1.0.3 do in simple terms?</A>
<P>
	<strong>A:</strong> JSSE implements a Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> version of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS
(Transport Layer Security)  protocols to provide for secure Internet
communications.
<p>

<P>Using JSSE, developers can provide for the passage of secure data between a
client and a server running any application protocol (such as HTTP, Telnet,
NNTP, and FTP) over TCP/IP. JSSE will enable data encryption, server
authentication, message integrity, and optional client authentication for a
TCP/IP connection.</P>

<p>
<LI><A NAME="2"><strong>Q:</strong> What is new in JSSE 1.0.3 compared to JSSE 1.0.2?
<P>

	<strong>A:</strong>  There were a number of bug fixes and
	enhancements.  For more details, please see the CHANGES.txt
	file that comes with the distribution.  <p>

<LI><A NAME="2a"><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between
JSSE 1.0.3 and the JSSE found in Sun's J2SDK version 1.4?</A><BR> <br>

	<strong>A:</strong>The <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4">
	J2SDK version 1.4 </A> bundles JSSE into the J2SDK framework.
	The code for the J2SDK v1.4 JSSE was based on JSSE 1.0.2, but
	contains some API enhancements and bug fixes.  Code written
	using JSSE 1.0.x should work on the J2SDK v1.4, but code
	written using API's exclusive to J2SDK v1.4 will not work in
	JSSE 1.0.3.

<p>
<LI><A NAME="3"><strong>Q:</strong>
	Where does JSSE fit in the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Security Architecture?
<P>
	<strong>A:</strong>
	JSSE is the latest development in the
	Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Security Architecture,
	building upon the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 Security Architecture in the core SDK,
	the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
	Cryptography Extension (JCE), the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
	Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS),
	and the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Security Tools.
        See the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/security/index.html">Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2  Security Architecture document</a> for more information.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="4"><strong>Q:</strong>
	Why should I be interested in JSSE APIs, JSSE 1.0.3 and commercial versions
of JSSE?
<P>
	<strong>A:</strong>
	JSSE enables developers to utilize secure, encrypted communications
channels in their applications.  It simplifies application development by
serving as a   building block which developers can integrate directly into
their applications.  Furthermore, by abstracting the complex underlying
security algorithms and &quot;handshaking&quot; mechanisms, JSSE  minimizes
the risk of creating subtle but dangerous security vulnerabilities.  
<p>
<LI><A NAME="5"><strong>Q:</strong>
	Is the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Secure Socket Extension a reference
implementation of the specification or a commercial product? 
<P>
	<strong>A:</strong>
	Sun's Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>  Secure Socket Extension 1.0.3 implementation is a reference
implementation. It is intended to familiarize developers with the APIs and the
technology before they make a choice on commercial implementations.
 A reference implementation is similar to a proof-of-concept
implementation of a specification.  It is used to demonstrate that
the specification is implementable and that various compatibility
tests can be written against it.
<p>
A non-commercial implementation typically lacks the overall completeness of a commercial-grade product. While the implementation meets the API specification, it will be lacking things such as a fully-featured toolkit, sophisticated debugging tools, commercial-grade documentation and  regular maintenance updates.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="6"><strong>Q:</strong>
	What is the cost of JSSE 1.0.3?
<P>
	<strong>A:</strong>
	The JSSE 1.0.3 reference implementation
	binary code is free for commercial use and redistribution. See the
license and the legal documents that are downloaded with the code.  

<p>

<LI><A NAME="6a"><strong>Q:</strong>
What is the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Export Affairs classification of JSSE 1.0.3?

<p>

<strong>A:</strong>

JSSE 1.0.3 has been classified as an ENC/Retail product by the U.S.
Department of Commerce Bureau of Export Affairs. This license exception
means that JSSE may be freely exported, without any additional
approval, with strong encryption, to all nations 
<A HREF="#8"> except for those specifically denied </A>.

<p>

<LI><A NAME="7"><strong>Q:</strong> I read that the US Government has relaxed the export restrictions on encryption products. Can the JSSE 1.0.3 reference implementation be downloaded by any organization, anywhere?
<P>

<strong>A:</strong> While there has been some relaxation in the export
requirements, there are many restrictions still in place for strong
encryption products.  Go to <a
href="http://www.epic.org/crypto/export_controls/regs_1_00.html">
http://www.epic.org/crypto/export_controls/regs_1_00.html</a> for the
complete 33 page report.  In addition, some countries may have import
restrictions.  Note also that a vendor's product status is dependent on
the type of application they have with the US government -- JSSE 1.0.3
has been classified as ENC/Retail. Contrary to some articles in the
press, export of encryption technology is still a complicated,
multi-dimensional issue.  You are advised to consult your export/import
control counsel or attorney to determine the exact requirements.

<p>

<LI><A NAME="8"><strong>Q:</strong> Now that the export requirements have been relaxed, can I download the JSSE 1.0.3 reference implementation if I'm in a country that has been subject to a US Government embargo?
<P>
	<strong>A:</strong> No.  Even with an ENC/Retail classification, the countries on the US Government embargo list may not receive <STRONG> ANY </STRONG> US-developed encryption items.  In addition, parties listed on the <a href="http://bxa.fedworld.gov/prohib.html">  Denied and Restricted Parties List</a>
are also not allowed to receive this kind of software.  Additionally, it is Sun company policy to not ship products to Burma.


<p>

<LI><A NAME="9"><strong>Q:</strong> I'm located in the US or Canada.  What encryption strength products can I download?
<P>
	<strong>A:</strong> If you are located in the US or Canada, you can download the 128 bit strength domestic JSSE 1.0.3 reference implementation. 

<p>



<LI><A NAME="10"><strong>Q:</strong> I'm located outside of the US and Canada.  What encryption strength products can I download?
<P>

<strong>A:</strong>  If you are located outside of the US or Canada,
you can download the 128 bit strength global JSSE 1.0.3 reference
implementation.  (This assumes you are not <A HREF="#8"> an embargoed
nation or a denied party.) </A>

<p>

<LI><A NAME="10a"><strong>Q:</strong> Since both the domestic and global version of JSSE 1.0.3 have strong encryption, why do you have two versions?
<P>
	<strong>A:</strong>  There are two versions to comply with the approved application Sun received from the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Export Affairs. The domestic version supports alternate SSL security 
providers; the global version supports only the Sun SSL provider.


<p>
<LI><A NAME="11"><strong>Q:</strong>
	What versions of the JDK<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 
	does JSSE 1.0.3 support? 
<P>
        <strong>A:</strong>
Sun's reference implementation supports Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2.x or 1.3.x.   The JSSE API is implementable on either JDK 1.1.x or Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 Platform, Standard Edition.  This implementation is <STRONG> not </STRONG> intended for use in the J2SDK version 1.4, which has a version of JSSE already bundled.
</P>

<p>

<LI><A NAME="14"><strong>Q:</strong>
	Does the reference implementation have the ability to do RSA encryption?
<P>
        <strong>A:</strong>
	Yes, JSSE 1.0.3 contains RSA encryption.  However, this
algorithm is not available to the applications using
the Java <sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Cryptography Extension (JCE) API.

<p>
<LI><A NAME="12"><strong>Q:</strong>

	What standard(s) does JSSE 1.0.3 follow?
<P>
        <strong>A:</strong>
	JSSE 1.0.3 provides  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) v3  and
Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 support to the  Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 Platform.

<p>

<LI><A NAME="15"><strong>Q:</strong>
	What versions of SSL are supported?  What versions of
	TLS are supported?
<P>
        <strong>A:</strong>
	JSSE 1.0.3 supports SSL version 3. It is widely available and generally believed to be more secure than version 2. SSL was originally developed by Netscape.  You can find out more about SSL by looking at <a href="http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/security.html#SS"> Netscape SSL information</a> or the <a href="http://home.netscape.com/eng/ssl3/ssl-toc.html">  SSL 3.0 Protocol Internet Draft</A>.  JSSE 1.0.3 supports TLS version 1, which can
be found at
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt?number=2246">
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt?number=2246
</A>.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="16"><strong>Q:</strong>
	Is the reference implementation of JSSE written in the
        Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> programming language? 
<P>
        <strong>A:</strong>
	Yes, the reference implementation is completely written in the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 
	programming language. 

<p>


<LI><A NAME="13a"><strong>Q:</strong>
	Is there any sample source code available?
<P>
        <strong>A:</strong>
	Sample source code, including directions for running the sample
	code, is provided with the JSSE 1.0.3 distribution as a separate bundle.

<p>
<p>
<LI><A NAME="17"><strong>Q:</strong>
	Something is not working. How can I debug what is going wrong? 
<P>
        <strong>A:</strong>


Use the dynamic debug tracing support. This is similar to 
 that used for debugging access control failures in Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>  2.
 You can configure this via the javax.net.debug system 
 property. A value of "help" will dump out the various
 options. For example: <br> <br>

<code> java -Djavax.net.debug=help SomeClass  </code>
 

<p>


<LI><A NAME="18"><strong>Q:</strong>
	It seems the first SSL connection takes longer than subsequent 
connections. Is there anything I can do to improve the performance of
the first connection? 
<P>
        <strong>A:</strong>
	The SSLContext needs a java.security.SecureRandom object. It is
expensive to seed a SecureRandom object. You should see better
performance for the first connection if you can provide a pre-seeded
SecureRandom object when initializing the SSLContext.  However, extreme
care should be taken in such action as seeding is an important aspect
of cryptographic effectiveness.

<p> 

<LI><A NAME="19"><strong>Q:</strong>
	What troubleshooting tips can you provide? 
<P>
       
        <strong>A:</strong>
	Troubleshooting Tips:	

<blockquote>

<a name="PkgNotFound"></a>
<H4>JSSE Package Not Found During Compilation</H4>

<blockquote>

<P> <b>Problem</b>: When compiling a program that uses the JSSE 1.0.3
packages, one of the following errors occur:

<pre>
    Package com.sun.net.ssl not found in import.

    Package javax.net not found in import.

    Package javax.net.ssl not found in import.

    Package javax.security.cert not found in import.
</pre>

<P> <b>Cause</b>: The JSSE JAR files are not installed properly.

<P> <b>Solution</b>: JSSE 1.0.3 is supplied as an extension to the Java
2 platform. Its JAR files can be installed either as "installed"
extensions (recommended) or as "bundled" extensions.  A JAR file is
considered an "installed" extension if it is stored in a particular
directory established for all installed extensions, as described in <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/install.html">
http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/install.html</a>, and no class path
modifications are needed.  "Bundled" extensions may be bundled with
applications or made available in a separate directory. If they are
bundled with an application, be sure to specify them in the Class-Path
attribute in the application's manifest file. Otherwise, be sure to set
the Java <code>CLASSPATH</code> variable correctly so the JSSE JAR
files can be found.  For more information about bundled extensions, see
<a href=
"http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/extensions/spec.html#bundled">
Bundled Extensions</a>.

</blockquote>


<H4>Runtime Exception: SSL Service Not Available</H4>

<blockquote>

<P> <b>Problem</b>: When running a program that uses JSSE 1.0.3, an
exception occurs indicating that an SSL service is not available.
For example, an exception similar to one of the following occurs:

<pre>
    Exception in thread "main"
        java.net.SocketException: no SSL Server Sockets

    Exception in thread "main":
        SSL implementation not available
</pre>

<P> <b>Cause 1</b>: The cryptographic service provider is not registered
properly.

<P> <b>Solution 1</b>: Before using JSSE 1.0.3, you must register the
<code>SunJSSE</code> provider, either statically by modifying the
<code>java.security</code> file or dynamically by calling the
<code>Security.addProvider</code> method, as described in
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/install.html">
http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/install.html</a>.

<P> <b>Cause 2</b>: There was a problem with <code>SSLContext</code>
initialization, for example due to a corrupted keystore. (Note: One
vendor has shipped a keystore in an unknown format, and that may cause
this type of error.)

<P> <b>Solution 2</b>: Check initialization parameters. Ensure any
keystores specified are valid (e.g., by trying to use the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/tools.html#security">
keytool</a> to examine them).

</blockquote>


<H4> Runtime Exception:  untrusted cert chains </H4>

<blockquote>

<P> <b>Problem</b>: When negotiating an SSL connection, the client or server
throws one of the following exceptions:

<pre>
    javax.net.ssl.SSLException: untrusted server cert chain
    javax.net.ssl.SSLException: untrusted client cert chain
</pre>

<P> <b>Cause 1</b>: This is generally caused by the remote side sending a
certificate that is unknown to the local side.

<P> <b>Solution 1</b>: The best way to
debug this type of problem is to turn on debugging and watch
as certificates are loaded and when certificates are
received via the network connection.  Most likely, the
received certificate is unknown to the trust mechanism because
the wrong trust file was loaded.

<P> <b>Cause 2</b>: The system clock is not set correctly.
<P> <b>Solution 2</b>: If the clock is not set correctly, the perceived
time may be outside the validity period on one of the certificates,
and unless the certificate can be replaced with a valid one from a
truststore, the system must assume that the certificate is invalid,
and therefore throw the exception.

<P> <b>Cause 3</b>: Older versions of Java 2 Enterprise Edition use
earlier versions of JSSE.  In particular, some previous versions of J2EE
shipped with JSSE 1.0, which couldn't replace received expired
certificates with current ones from a truststore.
<P> <b>Solution 3</b>: Be sure that the new JSSE jar files occur
in the class path(s) ahead of any older J2EE jar files.

</blockquote>


<H4>Runtime Exception: Class Definition Not Found</H4>

<blockquote>

<P> <b>Problem</b>: When running a program that uses JSSE 1.0.3, an
exception occurs indicating that a JSSE class definition cannot
be found. For example, an exception similar to the following occurs:

<pre>
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
        javax/net/ssl/SSLServerSocketFactory
</pre>

<P> <b>Cause</b>: The JSSE JAR files are not installed properly.

<P> <b>Solution</b>: JSSE must be installed as an extension to the Java
2 Platform. Install the JSSE JAR files as discussed in the Solution to
the <a href="#PkgNotFound">JSSE Package Not Found During Compilation</a>
problem shown above.

</blockquote>


<H4>Runtime Exception: No Cipher Suites in Common</H4>

<blockquote>

<P> <b>Problem</b>: When using Netscape Navigator or Microsoft
Internet Explorer (IE) to access files on a server that only has
DSA-based certificates, a runtime exception occurs indicating
that there are no cipher suites in common.

<P> <b>Cause</b>: By default, certificates created with keytool use
DSA public keys. Navigator and IE do not use DSA public
keys in their enabled cipher suites.

<P> <b>Solution</b>: To interact with Navigator or IE, you should create
certificates that use RSA-based keys. To do this, you need to specify
the <code>-keyalg</code> RSA option when using keytool. For
example:

<pre>
    keytool -genkey -alias duke -keystore testkeys -keyalg rsa
</pre>
